# Damien-Hirst-Inspired-Dot-Painting-using-Turtle
This project recreates a dot painting inspired by Damien Hirst's iconic dot style using Python and the Turtle graphics module.  
The colors have been extracted from an original piece of his, using the colorgram library.  
The color of the dots is completely random, which generates a 10x10 grid of dots.  
Enjoy this satisfying animation of the turtle making the painting!  
p.s. Ensure that you have Python installed with the turtle module.
